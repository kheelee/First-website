<p>Hello, welcome to my very first website! 
</p></div>
    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
   <p>My name is Geonhui Ryan Lee, I'm a self-motivated 22 years old who aspires to be a successful entrepreneur.
       <br>During quarantine, I saw that Harvard University was offering free courses so I decided to experience what the lectures are like. </p>
<p>Some of my other interests are:</p>
<ul><li>Travel</li> 
    <li>Spending time with family</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Business</li></ul>
<p>You can click on the items on the list for more details.</p>

<h3>Time Table</h3>
<p>During quarantine, I found it quite difficult to stay as effective as I was before.
<br>Therfore, I have came up with a morning routine to maximize my efficiency throughout the day.</p>
